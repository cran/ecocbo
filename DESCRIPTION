Description: A system for calculating the optimal sampling effort, based on the ideas of 
    "Ecological cost-benefit optimization" as developed by A. Underwood (1997, 
    ISBN 0 521 55696 1). Data is obtained from simulated ecological communities with
    prep_data() which formats and arranges the initial data, and then the 
    optimization follows the following procedure of four functions: (1) scompvar() 
    calculates the variation components necessary for (2) sim_cbo() to calculate
    the optimal combination of number of sites and samples depending on either 
    an economic budget or on a desired statistical accuracy. Additionally, (3) 
    sim_beta() estimates statistical power and type 2 error by using Permutational 
    Multivariate Analysis of Variance, and (6) plot_power() represents the 
    results of the previous function.

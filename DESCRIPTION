Description: A system for calculating the optimal sampling effort, based on the ideas of 
    "Ecological cost-benefit optimization" as developed by A. Underwood (1997, 
    ISBN 0 521 55696 1). Data is obtained from simulated ecological communities, 
    and the optimization follows the following procedure of four functions (1) 
    sim_beta() estimates statistical power and type 2 error by using Permutational 
    Multivariate Analysis of Variance, (2) plot_power() represents the results 
    of the previous function, (3) scompvar() calculates the variation components 
    necessary for (4) sim_cbo() to calculate the optimal combination of number 
    of sites and samples depending on either an economical budget or on a desired 
    statistical accuracy.

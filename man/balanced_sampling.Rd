  mm,
  nn,
  YPU,
  H0Sim,

  resultsHa,
  transformation,
  method
)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{pointer to the index in the list of experimental designs to try.}

\item{Y}{index to the data.frame the function will work with.}

\item{mm}{number of site the function is working with in each iteration.}

\item{nn}{number of samples to consider in each iteration.}

\item{YPU}{label for the sites in each iteration, as used by
\code{\link[sampling:balancedtwostage]{sampling::balancedtwostage()}}}

\item{H0Sim}{simulated community from \code{SSP::simdata()} in which H0 is
true.}

\item{HaSim}{simulated community from \code{SSP::simdata()} in which H0 is
false.}

\item{resultsHa}{helper matrix that stores labels and later the results.}

\item{transformation}{Mathematical function to reduce the weight of very
dominant species.}

\item{method}{appropriate distance/dissimilarity metric (e.g. Gower,
Brayâ€“Curtis, Jaccard, etc).}
}
\value{
a data frame with values for observed F (for H0 and Ha), and the Ha mean
squares for residuals and variation among sites.
